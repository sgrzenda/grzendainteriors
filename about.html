                    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>We believe that great design is about more than aesthetics—it's about creating spaces that enhance the way you live. Our approach combines modern minimalist principles with functional design to create homes that are both beautiful and livable.</p>
                    <p>With over 10 years of experience in residential interior design, we've had the privilege of working on diverse projects ranging from New York City penthouses to Central Coast ADUs. This breadth of experience has taught us that every space, regardless of size or location, has the potential to be transformed into something extraordinary.</p>
                    <p>Our design process is thoughtful and intentional. We focus on clean lines, quality materials, and timeless aesthetics that won't feel dated in years to come. As a member of the American Society of Interior Designers (ASID) with a Bachelor's Degree in Interior Design, we bring both formal training and real-world expertise to every project. We believe in the power of simplicity and the importance of creating spaces that bring joy and calm to daily life.</p>
