                <p>Minimalism isn't about deprivation—it's about intentionality. When applied to interior design, minimalist principles create spaces that are calm, functional, and beautiful. Here are five key principles to embrace minimalist living in your home.</p>

                <h2>1. Quality Over Quantity</h2>
                <p>Instead of filling your space with many items, invest in fewer, higher-quality pieces that truly serve a purpose and bring you joy. A well-made sofa that will last for years is better than multiple cheap pieces that need replacing.</p>

                <h2>2. Embrace Negative Space</h2>
                <p>White space isn't wasted space—it's essential. Allow your rooms to breathe by leaving areas empty. This creates visual calm and makes the items you do have stand out more.</p>

                <h2>3. Neutral Color Palettes</h2>
                <p>Minimalist design typically features neutral colors like white, beige, gray, and black. These colors create a serene backdrop and make spaces feel larger and more cohesive.</p>

                <h2>4. Functional Design</h2>
                <p>Every item should have a purpose. Before adding something to your space, ask yourself if it's functional, beautiful, or ideally both. Avoid decorative items that don't serve a clear purpose.</p>

                <h2>5. Hidden Storage</h2>
                <p>Clutter is the enemy of minimalism. Invest in smart storage solutions that keep everyday items out of sight. Built-in cabinets, under-bed storage, and multi-functional furniture help maintain clean lines.</p>

                <p>Remember, minimalism is personal. It's not about following strict rules, but about creating a space that feels right for you—one that's free from excess and full of intention.</p>
