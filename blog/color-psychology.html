                <p>Color is one of the most powerful tools in interior design. The colors you choose for your home can significantly impact your mood, energy levels, and overall well-being. Understanding color psychology helps you create spaces that support how you want to feel.</p>

                <h2>Blue: Calm and Serenity</h2>
                <p>Blue is known for its calming properties, making it ideal for bedrooms and bathrooms. It can lower blood pressure and heart rate, promoting relaxation. Lighter blues feel airy and spacious, while deeper blues add sophistication.</p>

                <h2>Green: Balance and Renewal</h2>
                <p>Green connects us to nature and promotes feelings of balance and renewal. It's versatile enough for any room and is particularly effective in home offices and living spaces where you want to feel both energized and calm.</p>

                <h2>White and Neutrals: Clarity and Space</h2>
                <p>White and neutral tones create a sense of openness and clarity. They're perfect for small spaces and serve as a blank canvas that allows other design elements to shine. Neutrals also promote feelings of peace and simplicity.</p>

                <h2>Warm Tones: Energy and Comfort</h2>
                <p>Warm colors like terracotta, warm beige, and soft yellows create cozy, inviting spaces. They're excellent for social areas like living rooms and dining rooms where you want to encourage conversation and connection.</p>

                <h2>Gray: Sophistication and Stability</h2>
                <p>Gray has become increasingly popular in modern design. It's sophisticated, timeless, and provides a neutral backdrop that works with almost any accent color. Different shades of gray can feel either warm or cool depending on their undertones.</p>

                <h2>Choosing Your Palette</h2>
                <p>When selecting colors for your home, consider the function of each room and how you want to feel in that space. Test paint samples in different lighting conditions, and don't be afraid to use color strategically—even in a minimalist home, the right accent color can make all the difference.</p>
